# The signgroup website

I would like to prefice this README by saying that I have no idea how to write a README, so you'll probably get better results if you ask me in person

## Installation

When installing, make sure you have semi-recent versions of node and npm, along with git.

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/Rufis72/signgroup"
cd signgroup
npm install
```

## Development

If you want to develop this on your local machine, after installing, run the following.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This project uses Vite, React, Typescript, Flask, TailwindCSS, and probably more I'm forgetting. So if you have some spare change, go donate to them!
